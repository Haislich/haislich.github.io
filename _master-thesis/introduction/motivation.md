## A little introduction

My curiosity for how things worked naturally led me to computers.
What started as a simple interest slowly grew into a passion, and later became a degree in Computer Engineering.
Over time, that same curiosity evolved toward Robotics and Artificial Intelligence.

## What got me curious

I’ve had back problems for as long as I can remember.
For years, I brushed them off until they became impossible to ignore.
Eventually, things got serious enough that I needed an urgent and delicate operation.

Before the surgery, the doctor told me plainly that there was a real chance I could end up completely paralyzed from the waist down.
As I was being taken to the operating room, that thought stayed with me, heavy and unavoidable.

Fortunately, the doctors did an incredible job.
With time and rehabilitation, I was able to walk again and live almost pain free.
Still, the idea of losing the ability to live life as I knew it never really left my mind.

At that time, I was just starting my first year of my master’s degree, a stage where textbooks no longer had all the answers and research papers became our main source of knowledge.
Naturally, I began to wonder:
if things hadn’t gone so well, what would the state of the art have been for someone like me?
What kind of solutions would I have had?

What I discovered was a field full of brilliant ideas and promising research, but still far from offering something people could rely on comfortably in their everyday lives.

## The realization

As I kept reading papers, something started to click.
The concepts, the language, the way problems were framed, weren't unfamiliar.
They were part of what I already did every day.
And with that realization, the idea of helping people, maybe even my future self, didn’t feel impossible anymore.
