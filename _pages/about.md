My name is José.
I’m a Guatemalan-born, Italian-naturalized computer and automation engineer, soon to become an AI and robotics engineer at Sapienza University of Rome.
I’m currently in Edinburgh working on my master’s thesis with the SLMC group, coordinated by Prof. Vijayakumar, while also working as a backend developer at SviluppoH.

I like to dance, go out, and see the world.
However, one of my favorite things is reading about computer programs (I know, I’m a nerd), although lately time has been tight, so I haven’t been able to turn much of that reading into real implementations.
I especially enjoy exploring topics like compilers, emulation, and the internals of scientific libraries such as NumPy and JAX.
In my daily work, I mostly use Python, Rust, SQL and **unfortunately** MATLAB.

My academic interests currently focus on sEMG and Functional Electrical Stimulation, but I’d like to explore more about reinforcement learning applied to real-world problems.
